What is Golem Gallery2?
=======================

Readers of Golem.de have constantly asked for a release of
our implementation of the image gallery used on the website.

With the new version of the image gallery named Golem.Gallery2 (aka GG2)
we fulfilled this wish and uploaded the source to GitHub.

The code is povided "as is" and is licensed under the LGPL 3. Golem.de nor its
owner, the Kla√ü&Ihlenfeld Verlag GmbH, will provide any support or code maintance.

Features
========
- Fullscreen mode
- Unlimited number of images
- Lazy loading of images
- Use Fullscreen-API of the browser, if available
- Keyboard support, even for several galleries on the same page
- Tested on FF15, IE8/9/10, Chrome21, Opera12, Safari5 on Desktop and Touch devices

Caveats
=======
The gallery implementation was developed to work on Golem.de and had to be ajusted to
internal requirements and some legacy stuff. It was never intended to create
a "fit-everywhere" solution. You may need a deeper understanding on how CSS works
to customize the gallery. The gallery initialization isn't parameterized,
so you can't disable functions like the fullscreen mode without modifying the
javascript class.

Prerequistes
============
The gallery relies heavily on JQuery. We recommand version 1.8.1. Older versions
may work.

The gallery uses the BigScreen library to handle the Fullscreen-API across
different browser. The library is not part of the distribution.

You also should install a CSS Reset stylesheet.

HTML and Images for an usage example

Installation
============
There are no special steps to follow. Just copy the "css", "js" and "images"
directories to a place where you need them and make sure they are accessible.

Setting up the HTML
===================
Adding 1 or more galleries to your webpage requires four steps:
(see also example/index.html in this distribution for a complete example)

1) Include the gallery javascript and css files:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/golemgallery2.css" type="text/css"/>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/bigscreen.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/golemgallery2.js"></script>

2) Create the gallery placeholder for each gallery to insert (see further explanation below)

<a class="golem-gallery2-nojs" href="https://github.com/alexmerz/golemde-gallery">
    <ul>
        <li><img src="" alt="Image 1" title="Image 1" data-src="images/img1.png" data-src-full="images/img1_big.png"></li>
        <li class="golem-gallery2-show"><img src="images/img2.png" alt="Image 2" title="Image 2" data-src="images/img2.png" data-src-full="images/img2_big.png"></li>
        <li><img src="" alt="Image 3" title="Image 3" data-src="images/img3.png" data-src-full="images/img3_big.png"></li>
    </ul>
    Image 2
</a>

3) Add the gallery template, taking the path to the image sources into account.
The value of the src-attribute must match your directory layout!
You need only one template even if you have several galleries on the same page!

<div class="golem-gallery2-template">
    <ul class="golem-gallery2-list"></ul>
    <ul class="golem-gallery2-nav">
        <li class="golem-gallery2-nav-prev"><img src="../images/left.png"></li>
        <li class="golem-gallery2-nav-count"><span class="golem-gallery2-nav-count-current"></span> / <span class="golem-gallery2-nav-count-all"></span></li>
        <li class="golem-gallery2-nav-next"><img src="../images/right.png"></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="golem-gallery2-footer">
        <li class="golem-gallery2-footer-hide"><img src="../images/minus.png"></li>
        <li class="golem-gallery2-footer-title"></li>
        <li class="golem-gallery2-footer-fullscreen"><img src="../images/big.png"></li>
    </div>
</div>

4) Add the javascript part to initialize the galleries (explanation see below)

<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function() {
        Golem.Gallery2.init(function(eventData) {
            // do something usefull if required
        });
    });
</script>

The gallery placeholder
=======================
The gallery placeholder performs 3 tasks: it marks the position of the gallery,
houses the image data for the gallery and serves as a fallback, if javascript
is disabled.

As fallback, the whole placeholder acts as a link to an URL. On Golem.de that
URL is a page where the gallery images can be viewed without javascript.

You must provide each image of the gallery as an <LI> element and an
<IMG> element in the placeholder. The simplest form ist:

<li><img src="" alt="" title="" data-src="path/small_image" data-src-full="path/big_image"></li>

The data-src attribute contains the image URL for the regular view,
data-src-full for the fullscreen view. The attributes alt and title should be
set. The content of title is shown as a subtitle of the image, so make sure
html is properly encoded.

To mark an image to be shown first, add the class golem-gallery2-show to
the <LI> element and also fill the src attribute of the <IMG> element:
<li class="golem-gallery2-show"><img src="path/small_image" alt="" title="" data-src="path/small_image" data-src-full="path/big_image"></li>

If you do not provide a <LI> element with the class element, the
first image in the list is shown.

Gallery initializion
====================
You must call the javascript function Golem.Gallery2.init() to let the magic
happen. Be careful, the DOM must be completely loaded, so
put the call into a $(document).ready() call provided by JQuery:

$(document).ready(function() {
    Golem.Gallery2.init();
});

You may pass a function to the init method. This function is called, if the
user navigates to another image in the gallery.
